My training at the Northern Electricity Distribution Company was a transformative experience that bridged theoretical learning and real technical application.
Through exposure to networking, databases, cybersecurity, and hardware systems, I gained valuable insights into IT infrastructure management in large institutions.
This experience strengthened my technical expertise, analytical thinking, and adaptability—laying a strong foundation for a career in Information Technology and Systems Engineering.
